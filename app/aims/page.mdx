## The Legume Grain ‘Omics Initiative

The Legume Grain ‘Omics Initiative is supported by funding from **Bioplatforms
Australia** (enabled by the **National Collaborative Research Infrastructure
Strategy, NCRIS**). The initiative aims to use ‘omics technologies, including
genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and phenomics (via collaboration with the
NCRIS-enabled **Australian Plant Phenomics Network**) to:

- **Create a national ‘omics resource** for selected pulse varieties, capturing
  genomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and phenomic data.
- **Accelerate fundamental research** by using this resource to understand how
  key traits, such as yield, nutrition, and stress resilience, develop over time
  and under different environmental conditions.
- **Support crop improvement** by generating insight to guide the optimisation
  of pulse crops for agriculture and market performance.
- **Develop accessible ‘Atlases’** that organise and present the multilayered
  data sets, providing a model for other industries to identify value-adding
  opportunities.
- **Build a strong national network** of stakeholders, including researchers,
  growers, government, industry, consumers, and health professionals, to support
  a sustainable and high-quality Australian plant protein sector.

As a first proof-of-concept, the Legume Grain ‘Omics Initiative generated the
**Faba Bean ‘Omics Atlas**.
