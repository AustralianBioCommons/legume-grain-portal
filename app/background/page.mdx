  ## Grain legumes are important food and feed

Global food systems will need to nearly double their production to **feed the
expected global population by 2050**. The demand for meat alone is projected to
rise by 73% in response to a growing population and increased protein demand
across both developed and developing countries. To meet this goal and mitigate
the environmental sustainability challenges posed by meat production, the
production and consumption of healthy and **sustainable alternative proteins**,
such as those derived from pulse crops, need to be substantially increased.

Advancing the current market trade of pulses as commodities to **value-added
products** (e.g., protein concentrate, protein isolates, starch and fibre)
presents a **leadership and economic opportunity for Australia**. However,
effort is required to establish the core knowledge that underpins the long-term
sustainability and profitability of pulses grown in Australia. Key knowledge
gaps to developing an Australian plant protein pipeline include:

- Characterising the relationship between yield and grain quality for target
  pulse crops.
- Assessment of regional, paddock variability (within and between paddocks) on
  protein content and seed composition.
- Profiling the impact of common environmental stresses such as frost, heat,
  terminal drought, and soil composition on grain quality and off-flavour
  traits.

## Role of grain legumes in smart agriculture

Grain legumes, such as **chickpeas, lentils, lupins, faba beans, and field
peas**, are essential components of sustainable agricultural systems in
Australia. These crops are valued not only for their economic returns but also
for their **agronomic benefits**:

- As **nitrogen-fixing plants**, legumes enrich soil fertility by converting
  atmospheric nitrogen into forms usable by subsequent crops, **reducing the
  need for synthetic fertilisers**.
- Their inclusion in crop rotations helps **break pest and disease cycles**,
  improves soil structure, and enhances overall farm resilience.
- Legumes contribute to **climate-smart agriculture** by lowering greenhouse gas
  emissions and supporting biodiversity.

## Nutritional benefits

Grain legumes are a cornerstone of **plant-based diets** and an increasingly
important ingredient in **health-conscious food products**, including flours,
snacks, meat substitutes, and dairy alternatives. Grain legumes are highly
regarded for their **nutritional value**.

For humans:

- High protein content.
- Low glycemic index.
- Rich supply of dietary fibre, vitamins (especially folate), and minerals (such
  as iron and zinc).

In animal feed:

- Lupins and field peas are used as protein-rich supplements, especially in
  monogastric diets (e.g., pigs and poultry).
- Reduced reliance on imported products.

## Economic value of grain legumes in Australia

In 2025, Australia's grain legume sector is projected to produce approximately
**4.6 million tonnes across the five major crops**. Collectively, the grain
legume industry is **valued at approximately AUD 3.4 to 4 billion**, playing a
crucial role in economic sustainability, ecological health, and the **growing
demand for plant-based protein** in both food and feed markets.
